# speech-to-braille
In the framework of Girls in AI (2021-Tunisia), this is part of the project, entitled "BrAIlle". It is about addressing the inequality of access to education and giving blind people a chance to have a note-taking or a Braille transcript. The whole team chose after several researches on already existing solutions to innovate, and go further, by creating a platform that will be accompanied by a Braille printer. Thus, this BrAIlle platform allows you to save a voice file and convert it to Braille in order that it may be printed with the braille embosser. (This conversion: vocal to braille is done in two main steps: 1. Vocal to written conversions 2. written to braille conversion.) Also, we would like to add that this prototype is far from finished, we have the project to first finish the two major steps in order to finalize the function of voice conversion to braille. Then we will create features that will allow you to take an image/photo and convert it to braille. Then, we will set up a forum between the blind in the same class so that they can exchange voice messages and help each other.
